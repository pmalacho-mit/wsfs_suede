"""The wire shapes, and the only place they are declared.

A second copy of a contract does not stay a copy. There was one, written as
TypeScript beside the architecture notes, and by the time anybody checked it
disagreed with this file about what a draft was. The client's types are
GENERATED from this one (`release/frontend/generate.py`), so the two cannot
drift without the build saying so.

Identity is client-minted throughout. A transaction id is chosen by the client
before it sends anything, and after the server applies it that same id is the
CAS token for the property it changed -- so a client knows, at mint time and
without a round trip, what token its own work will produce. That is what lets
an outbox chain: each queued item presents the id of the item before it.

Mint with a platform CSPRNG (`crypto.randomUUID()`), never `Math.random()`;
UUIDv7 is preferred for index locality on append-only tables. Mint once and
reuse the same id on every retry -- that is what makes a retry free.
