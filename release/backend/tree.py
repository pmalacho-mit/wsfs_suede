"""What the tree currently denotes.

An entry's name, parent, deletion and content each live in their own log, so
"the current tree" is a query, not a table: for every entry, the newest row in
each of those logs.

Every query here is a query over ONE schema, which is why this is a class
rather than a module of functions -- the schema is the thing they all share,
and it is not known until a host says which tables its users and workspaces
live in.
