"""The router a host mounts, and the units of work behind it.

Every WRITE -- transactional requests and Initialize alike -- flows through the
workspace's controller: serialized per workspace, fanned out after commit.
READS (Content, blobs) bypass it; MVCC handles them.

Nothing here decides anything that belongs to the host. It is handed a schema
(`build_models`), a database, a blob store, and a dependency that says which
user may reach a workspace -- and it makes no other assumption about either.

TOPOLOGY INVARIANT: exactly one process serves a workspace's writes and

        Folders along the way are created as needed and reused when they are
        already there.

        DECLARATIVE, and therefore worth calling twice: a path already holding
        exactly that text is left completely alone -- no transaction, no
        position, no event -- so a second call with the same argument is free
        and silent.

        `prune` deletes every live entry these paths did not name, which is
        what turns "put these files here" into "make the workspace look like
        this". Off by default because it is the one thing here that destroys
        something.

        `user` is who this is done on behalf of, and nothing here checks them
        -- see the class docstring. `warm` settles each moved file's
        collaboration room before returning.

        Raises `place.Unusable`, before writing anything, for a call that
        cannot be satisfied at all: a path that is not a path, one path given
        twice, or one path asked to be both a file and the folder above
        another. What the WORKSPACE declines comes back in `Placed.refused`.
