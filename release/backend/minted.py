"""When a transaction happened on the client, read out of the id it happened as.

A UUIDv7 carries, in its first 48 bits, the Unix epoch MILLISECONDS at which it
was minted -- and this client mints a transaction's id at the moment the user
acts, before anything is sent. So "when did this happen on the client" is
already on the wire, in the primary key, and storing it in a column beside that
key would be storing the same fact twice. Nothing here writes anything.

WHAT A v7 DOES NOT CARRY IS A TIMEZONE. Its timestamp is an INSTANT, counted
from the epoch, and an instant is the same number in Cupertino and in Berlin.
That is the property you want for ordering and for storage, and it is exactly
the wrong one for "show me the time on the clock I was looking at": a user who
works in Los Angeles on Monday and London on Tuesday produces two ids that say
nothing about which was which. The offset has to be carried alongside, which is
why `Transacted.offset` exists and why it rides on each transaction rather than
on the connection -- see the note there.

The instant is CLIENT-REPORTED, and a client's clock is its own. A skewed one
mints ids that claim a time nobody experienced, and a hostile one can claim any
time at all. Nothing here trusts it: `Occurrence.accepted` is the server's own
clock, and it is the one to reconcile against when the two disagree.
