"""SQLModel tables of record, built against a host schema.

An entry is pure identity. Its name, its parent, its deletion and its content
each live in their own append-only table, and each row records the workspace
position it landed at. Current state is therefore not a row anyone overwrites
-- it is the newest row per property -- so history costs nothing extra and the
log cannot drift from the truth.

Identity is minted by the client, and one identifier does three jobs: the id
of a transaction is the primary key of the row it applies, the dedup key that
makes a retry free, and the CAS token the next mutation of that property must
present. A client can therefore predict the token its own work will produce,
which is what lets it compose a whole session's work offline.

Only transactions that were applied are recorded. A refused one changed
nothing, so there is nothing to store: presenting it again re-runs the same
adjudication and produces the same reason (see `service.refusal`).

These rows are also the event stream: one applied transaction takes exactly
one position, and which table its rows are in IS which event it was. There is
nothing else to write, and so nothing that can disagree.

NOTHING HERE IS A MODULE-LEVEL TABLE. A foreign key names its target table in
the field itself, so a table pointing at somebody else's users cannot exist
until somebody says which table that is -- which is why `build_models` creates
the classes rather than a mixin decorating them. What this package owns is the
shape; the host owns identity, and hands over two table names.
