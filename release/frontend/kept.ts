/**
 * The outbox, across page loads.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. Everything else in this client exists so that work
 * reaches the server: the queue holds what has not been answered, chained
 * writes keep every snapshot rather than only the last, drafts keep text that
 * has reached nobody. All of it lived in one closure, and a reload emptied it.
 * A design whose whole claim is "a user never loses work" cannot keep the only
 * copy of that work in memory.
 *
 * BY WORKSPACE, and that is not tidiness. Queued work leaves the outbox when
 * the STREAM carries it, and a client only follows the stream of the workspace
 * it is looking at. Navigate to another one and the first one's queue has no
 * route to be drained -- so it must survive being unattended, and drain when
 * the user comes back. Every record here is scoped to a workspace for exactly
 * that reason.
 *
 * ROWS, NOT A DOCUMENT. Each queued item is its own record under its own
 * transaction. Two tabs on one workspace share this storage, and appending and
 * removing single rows is something they can both do without either of them
 * reading a whole outbox and writing back a version that forgot the other's
 * work.
