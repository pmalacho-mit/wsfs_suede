/**
 * The queue of work this client has accepted and the server has not yet
 * answered.
 *
 * Successive writes to one entry CHAIN. They used to coalesce -- a later write
 * replaced an earlier one and inherited its token -- which kept the queue at
 * one item per file but threw away every snapshot but the last. A consumer
 * that writes at particular moments, so it can later say what the code was
 * when the user did some thing, needs all of them to reach the server. So each
 * one is kept, in order, and `writes.ts` puts one on the wire at a time.
 *
 * What keeps that from costing a document per keystroke is that a chained
 * write is stored as a DELTA against the one before it -- see `delta.ts`. The
 * head of a chain holds whole text; everything behind it holds an edit script,
 * which is the size of what changed rather than the size of the file. A queue
 * that has been offline all afternoon is a document and a pile of diffs.
 *
 * And an item is a row of POINTERS: content lives in the byte store under its
 * hash, never inline on the request. That was the claim this file already
 * made, and for text it was false -- the text sat in `request.content` AND
 * under its digest, so the store bought nothing on the commonest payload
 * there is. `content: null` on a queued write means "the bytes are the store's
 * business", and `writes.ts` puts them back on the way out.
