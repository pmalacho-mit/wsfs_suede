/**
 * Reading a file, in the order the answers are trustworthy.
 *
 *   1. the cache, keyed by the content token the last event announced
 *   2. the server
 *
 * The cache is keyed by TOKEN rather than by id, which is what makes it
 * correct without an invalidation step: a `write` event advances the token, so
 * the cache line for the old one simply stops being asked for.
 *
 * WHO ELSE to trust is not decided here. An editor holding a buffer somebody
 * is typing into knows something this does not, and it is the consumer that
 * knows it has one -- so preferring it is the consumer's rule to write, over
 * the top of this.
