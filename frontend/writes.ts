/**
 * One content write per entry on the wire at a time.
 *
 * The server's compare-and-swap is exact: a write presents the token it
 * believes is current, and if it is not, the write is refused. That is the
 * right rule, and this client used to break it against itself. Two writes to
 * one file minted moments apart BOTH read the same token, because a queued
 * write is deliberately not laid over `content_version` -- see the note in
 * `effective.ts`, which is about keeping the content cache honest. So the
 * second one presented a token the first had already replaced, and lost.
 *
 * The fix is not to relax the swap. It is to stop asking two questions with
 * one answer:
 *
 *   - what token invalidates my cached bytes?   the confirmed one, still
 *   - what token do I write against?            the one in front of me
 *
 * The second question is this file's. Writes to one entry queue in order, one
 * goes out at a time, and the next presents the transaction of the one before
 * it once that one has been accepted. A chain of a client's own writes lands
 * as a chain. A write from somebody ELSE landing in the middle still refuses
 * everything behind it, because their token is one nobody here can name --
 * which is the protection the swap exists to give, kept intact.
 *
 * Waiting for the answer, rather than the stream event, is what makes the
 * queue affordable: only the head of a chain holds whole text, and the rest
 * are deltas against it, so the wait costs a diff rather than a document.
