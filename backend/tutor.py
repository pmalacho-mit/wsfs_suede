"""The tutor: what it is asked, what it is shown, and what it says back.

NOTHING HERE IMPORTS A MODEL LIBRARY. What a tutor is, to this package, is one
method: given what has been said, produce more text. `ITutor` is that method,
the host supplies it -- exactly as it supplies a collaboration server -- and
`llm.py` is the one that actually talks to anybody.

That seam is not ceremony. It is what lets the whole feature be driven in a
test, on a machine with no API key, against a tutor that says what the test
told it to.

WHAT A GENERATION IS. Answering is slower than a request should be, so asking
and reading the answer are two calls: the first records the question and starts
the work, the second attaches to it. In between, the work belongs to nobody --
which is the point. A person who asks and closes the tab has still asked, and
the answer is written down whether or not anyone was listening. Losing the
connection loses the live text and nothing else; the transcript has it.
