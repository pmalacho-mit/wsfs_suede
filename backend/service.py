"""Adjudication, and the one path every applied mutation takes.

The two halves are kept apart on purpose.

`refusal()` is judgement, and it is pure: it reads the workspace and answers
why a request cannot be applied, or None. Nothing about a refusal is stored,
because nothing about a refusal happened -- presenting the same transaction
again re-runs this function and produces the same answer, computed against the
workspace as it stands rather than as it once stood.

`approve()` is the choke point, and it is the only thing that writes: it takes
the next workspace position, stamps it onto the rows, and appends them -- all
in the caller's single database transaction. The rows ARE the event log, so
there is nothing that could drift from them.

Dedup therefore only has to protect what was applied: finding a transaction id
in the logs means the change already happened, and the recorded answer is
served instead of a second application. Which logs hold it says WHICH change,
so an id reused for a different operation is refused rather than acknowledged
into silence.

Every CAS token is per-property. A write does not invalidate a concurrent
rename, because the rename presents the name's token and the write moved the
content's -- the two are independent by construction.
