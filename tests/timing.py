"""When a transaction happened -- on the client that made it, and on the server.

Two clocks, recorded two different ways and for two different reasons.

The client's is not sent at all. A transaction's id is a UUIDv7 minted at the
moment the user acted, and a v7 carries its own millisecond, so the instant is
already in the primary key and the server reads it back out. What a v7 cannot
carry is which clock the client was reading, so the offset -- and only the
offset -- rides on the request.

The server's is stamped as the row is applied. It is the half that can be
trusted, and after an offline week it is days away from the other one.
