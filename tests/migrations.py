"""Bringing a database that already exists up to the schema the code expects.

`create_all` creates missing TABLES and does nothing about missing COLUMNS, so
a schema change against a database that has been running is silent until the
first write, which then fails with `column ... does not exist`. That has
happened twice.

What this does is the safe half -- adding columns -- and what it refuses to do
is the rest. A column the code no longer declares might be holding the only
copy of something, and dropping it to make the schema match is a data decision
nobody asked for.
