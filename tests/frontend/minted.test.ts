/**
 * The client half: reading a time out of an id, and showing it on the clock

 *
 * The interesting question is not "can a v7 be parsed" -- it is what a v7
 * REFUSES to tell you. Its timestamp is an instant, so it is the same number
 * wherever it was minted, and the offset that makes it readable as a wall clock
 * has to travel beside it. Most of what is below is about that.
