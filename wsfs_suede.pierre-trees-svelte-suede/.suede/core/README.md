# [Suede](https://github.com/pmalacho-mit/suede) Core (`release`)

Vendored at `.suede/core` on your dependency's **`release`** branch — which
means it ships, and a consumer who installs your dependency finds these at
`<dependency>/.suede/core/`. They are the tools for working with an installed
dependency.

The maintainer's half (the publish guard, `diff`, `vendor`, and the installer
itself) is vendored from `dependency/main/core` onto `main`, at the same path.

This folder is a [git-subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo) of the
suede library, so you get fixes by pulling: `git subrepo pull .suede/core`.

## [upstream](./upstream)

Propose this dependency's **local changes back to the library**, as a reviewable
PR against the library's `main`.

Use it when you've edited a vendored dependency in place and want those edits to
become a contribution to the library itself (rather than living only in your repo).

### Usage

```bash
<dependency>/.suede/core/upstream        # if executable
bash <dependency>/.suede/core/upstream   # otherwise
```

First commit the changes you want to send — the working tree must be clean.

### What it does

1. Splits the dependency's local commits out via `git subrepo` and pushes them to
   a deterministic branch on the library's remote:
   `downstream/<owner>/<repo>-<your-commit>`.
2. The library's `suede-downstream-to-main` workflow rebuilds that branch as a
   `main`-shaped PR head and opens the pull request for the maintainers to test,
   fix, and merge.
3. Your local state is restored afterward, so a later `git subrepo pull` stays
   safe. The `release` branch is **never** modified, so other consumers are
   unaffected.

Each commit becomes its own snapshot/branch/PR; re-running on the same commit is a
no-op (it detects the already-open proposal).

### Notes

- It's a thin bootstrapper: the real logic is hosted at `https://suede.sh/upstream`
  so it can evolve without re-shipping dependencies. Override the host (for forks
  or testing) with `SUEDE_UPSTREAM_URL`.
- Requires `git`, `curl`, and [`git-subrepo`](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo).
- Pass `-r`/`--remote <name>` to push to a remote other than the one tracked in
  the dependency's `.gitrepo`.
## [sync](./sync.sh)

`git subrepo pull`, runnable from any working directory.

```bash
bash <dependency>/.suede/core/sync.sh <path> [<path> ...]
```

Two things it does that a bare `git subrepo pull` will not: it runs from the
repository root with a root-relative path, so where you are does not matter; and
it dereferences a symlink to the real folder first, because `git subrepo pull`
on a symlink path fails outright — and the edge entries suede creates between
your dependencies are symlinks by default.

`git subrepo pull` also requires a clean working tree, while installing does
not. If you have just installed something, commit before syncing.
