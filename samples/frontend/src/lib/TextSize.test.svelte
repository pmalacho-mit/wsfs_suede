  /**
   * The slider on each panel, and what it is for.
   *
   * The complaint behind all of this: a workspace is as often SHOWN as worked
   * in -- somebody teaching from a laptop, with a room reading the projection
   * -- and the size that is comfortable at arm's length is unreadable from the
   * back. The browser's own zoom is not an answer, because it takes the layout
   * with it: three panels that no longer fit beside each other is not a bigger
   * workspace.
   *
   * So each test here asks the same two questions of one panel. Did the text
   * actually get bigger -- MEASURED, in rendered pixels, rather than by the
   * presence of a control -- and did the panel stay where it was while that
   * happened. The second is the one that would have caught a slider wired to
   * the browser's zoom instead, which looks identical in a screenshot of a
   * single panel and is wrong.
   *
   * These need no backend at all: `offline` answers the wire with entries to
   * draw and refuses every mutation, which is enough to measure text with and
   * nothing like enough to prove anything about storing.
   *
   * One workspace per test with FILE NAMES OF ITS OWN, because the editor
   * registers a workspace's paths in a filesystem that is global to the page
   * and two tests naming the same file collide there rather than in a backend.
