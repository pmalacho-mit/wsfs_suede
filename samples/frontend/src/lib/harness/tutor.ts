/**
 * A tutor for a panel test: says what the test told it to, at once.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE REAL ONE. The sample host answers with an actual model when it
 * has a key, which is what somebody opening the app wants and the opposite of
 * what a suite wants: every run would cost money and no two would say the same
 * thing. What these tests are about is the panel -- that a question appears,
 * that an answer streams into it, that scrolling back asks for more -- and
 * every one of those is true whoever is answering.
 *
 * The wire itself is tested where it can be tested honestly: against a
 * scripted tutor in `tests/tutor.py`, over real HTTP.
