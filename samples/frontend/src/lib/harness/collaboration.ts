 * an IndexedDB too -- so a suite that passed there would be proving something
 * about one client talking to itself.
 *
 * So the same suite runs in Chromium and in Firefox at once, and each test
 * plays a different part depending on which one it is in. `me()` is which.
 *
 * The two cannot tell each other anything directly -- that is the thing under
 * test -- so they meet on the host, at `/rendezvous`. Two primitives are
 * enough: agreeing on a value neither of them can pick alone, and waiting for
 * the other to say it has got somewhere.
