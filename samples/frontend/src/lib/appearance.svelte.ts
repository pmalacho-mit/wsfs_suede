/**
 * Which way the shell paints.
 *
 * The grid, the dock and the tree each draw their own chrome and each has to
 * be told; they live in different panels, so the answer cannot be a prop
 * threaded through one of them. One matcher, read by whoever needs it.
 *
 * What it resolves to is mode-watcher's business: the system's preference
 * until somebody overrides it, and their override -- kept in local storage --
 * from then on. `<ModeWatcher />` is what puts the answer on the document,
 * which is how the stylesheet's `.dark` variant sees it.
