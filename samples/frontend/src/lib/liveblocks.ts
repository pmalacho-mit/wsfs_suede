/**
 * A Liveblocks client for a room with nobody else in it.
 *
 * The editor binds monaco to a `Y.Doc`, and `LiveblocksYjsProvider` is what
 * carries that doc to everyone else. Carrying it somewhere needs an account,
 * a key and a network -- none of which a browser test has, and none of which
 * the sample needs to be useful on its own.
 *
 * So this is a real provider talking to a room that is genuinely empty. Not a
 * room that never answers: an empty room that ANSWERS, which is a different
 * thing and the one that matters. A file is only ever filled from the
 * workspace once the room has said it holds nothing, so a room that stayed
 * silent would leave every file looking empty forever.
 *
 * It is written against what `LiveblocksYjsProvider` actually asks a room
 * for, which is a short list -- and two items on it, `kInternal` and the ydoc
 * message shape, are not things the library considers public. That is the
 * fragile part: a Liveblocks upgrade can move them, and the failure will look
 * like a constructor throwing or a file that never opens.
