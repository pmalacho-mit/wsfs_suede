/**
 * What the person at this keyboard did to a Monaco editor.
 *
 * `onDidChangeModelContent` fires for everything: the user typing, a peer's
 * keystroke arriving through y-monaco, a formatter, a chat edit, the binding
 * seeding the model on attach. Focus is a poor way to tell those apart -- it
 * says where the caret is, not who caused the edit, so anything landing while
 * the caret sits here is attributed to this person whether they did it or not.
 *
 * Two signals do better, and this uses both because neither is sufficient on
 * its own:
 *
 *  1. `detailedReasons` -- VS Code tags every model edit with what caused it
 *     (`cursor`/`type`, `cursor`/`paste`, `applyEdits`, `setValue`, `suggest`,
 *     `Chat.applyEdits`, ...). This is the only signal that names the gesture,
 *     and it works before there is any shared document at all. It is also the
 *     fragile half: the field is on the runtime event but absent from the
 *     public typings, so it is read defensively and its absence is survivable.
 *
 *  2. The Yjs transaction origin -- y-monaco applies a peer's edit to the
 *     model from inside a Yjs transaction, so any model change occurring while
 *     a transaction that is NOT this editor's own binding is in flight did not
 *     come from this person. This half is public, stable Yjs API, and it
 *     catches remote edits even if the first signal ever goes away.
 *
 * The Y.Text is optional and attachable later, because the interesting case is
 * an editor that opens on server content and only joins the shared document
 * once the provider has synced. Before it is attached, signal 1 does the work
 * alone and every edit is reported with `shared: false` -- the person is still
 * editing, their edits just are not going anywhere yet.
