"""A sample host application, of the kind wsfs is meant to be mounted into.

Everything here is the HOST's: its own users, its own workspaces, its own idea
of who may reach one. wsfs is handed two table names and a dependency, and
decides nothing else -- which is the whole point of the exercise, and the
reason this lives outside `release/`.

The test suite drives wsfs through this app rather than through a fixture of
its own, so the integration path is the one under test.
